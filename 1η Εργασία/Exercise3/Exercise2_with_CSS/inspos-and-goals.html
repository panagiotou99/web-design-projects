					<h3>Childhood Inspirations</h3>
					<p>
						Although I was growing up in a provincial area, thanks to my parents I was in touch with technology from a really young age. Our family's first ever CD-Rom game was "Maths and English with Rayman". I didn't understand the math or english, but I enjoyed every second playing it. When I was about 6 years old, my father started buying me these educational CD games called "Perris and Katia" which featured two animated animals,a dog and a cat who spoke Greek! Playing these games taught me a lot of stuff related to software and hardware back then. I even learned how to use my family's Windows 95 computer to browse the webpage "<a href="http://www.caiman.us" target="_blank">Caiman</a>", so I could download loads of bootleg freeware games. The irony is that I barely knew how to spell my name at that time! I really miss the feeling of excitement that Windows 95 and XP gave me. Everything was really simple back then, but had a lot more charm

						Later on, I realised that I had a love for handheld technology. I would stare at promotional leaflets of MP4s, GameBoys and GPS devices for hours. I was in awe of how I was able to play video games on the go, or take pictures with digital cameras that fitted in my pocket. I especially loved tiny video games, like "Tamagotchi", the OG virtual pet and "Pokémon Mini". And how could I forget about the Java mobile games in my brother's Sony Ericsson Walkman flip phone? These games were so inspiring to me, even though they had mediocre graphics.

					<p> Nintendo's handheld consoles had a huge impact on me as well. As 90s boys, my brothers had a GameBoy Color and a GameBoy Advance , so they would let me play Pokémon  there (although they only allowed me to do silly stuff, like breeding). When I was in 3rd grade, I finally convinced my parents to buy me the original "Nintendo DS" so I could play Pokémon  Diamond. Let me tell you, nothing in the world makes me feel more nostalgic than this specific game. I have spent more than 450 hours playing it and I haven't regretted a minute. Even though I don't really care about the modern Nintendo games now, it would be an honor to work for the company some day.

					<h3>Teenage Inspirations</h3>
					<p>When I was about 9, I learned the basics of video editing using the iconic "Windows Movie Maker 2.6". I later moved on to "Windows Live Movie Maker" (because Windows 7 came out) and at the same time started to get the hang of "Power Director 8". I think it's a good time to mention that during this time my dream job was to be a director and editor. Now for the sad part... I never got to develop my skills because I never good equipment, actors to film or hardware to run more professional software like Adobe After Effects. So, through the years I gradually stopped dreaming about all that jazz.

					<p> In 2008, I created my first account on facebook, which was later banned because I was under 13 years old. Of course this didn't stop me from creating a second account. A little bit later, I got the hang of Twitter and Windows Live Messenger (MSN). Most of my friends weren't allowed to create profiles on facebook, so we used to chat in online virtual worlds like "IMVU", "Ameba Pico" and "Club Penguin". The concept of chat rooms and especially virtual worlds really intrigued me at that time.

					<p>In middle school. I got my first android phone and (unfortunately) I discovered "Android Games". I consumed countless of hours playing games I don't even recall right now. However, this experience taught me one important thing: you don't need a huge budget to make something that will make you tons of money. You just need to code an ugly android game (Yes, I'm looking at you "Pou"). My first experience with web design was during the "Tumblr Days". Every teenager who "thought" they were artistic had a blog on tumblr, which was editable using HTML and CSS. I had so much fun with it. I remember saying to myself "If this is what web developing is, then I want to do it". So naive of me.

					<h3> What inspires me now</h3>
					<p>
						People change through the years. Even though I still like a lot of things from my younger years, I don't want to be stationary, so I try to broaden my horizons. I love watching old movies, especially from the genre of horror. I often brainstorm ideas about "interactive" movies and video games. I also get inspired by my love for animals. I've stopped eating meat since October 2020 and I'm trying to be more environmentally aware. My two favorite animal species are Red Pandas and Otters. I believe that technology can coexist wih nature, so I like to come up with innovative ideas for software that will make the current situation a bit better. It's mandatory that I mention Artificial Intelligence and Robots too. Every time I watch videos of robots interacting normally with a human, it reassures me that I picked the right career path.

					<h3>Goals for the future</h3>

					<p>
						My main ambition is to become a professional software engineer. Starting my own software business is something else I am hoping to accomplish in the future, but maybe after my thirties. I woudn't mind working as a full stack developer either, because I enjoy the creativity of front end as much as I love setting up and organising databases. Whatever my future leads me to, what matters to me is that at the end of the day I feel satisfied with my occupation and not just do it for the cash.
