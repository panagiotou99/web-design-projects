					<h3>Early Years</h3>
					<p>Panagiotis Panagiotou was born in Patras,Greece on July 3,1999. He grew up in Nafpaktos, a really small town located in Aetolia-Acarnania. He didn't have many friends growing up, so he befriended technology to fill the void. By the age of 6, he knew all the basics of using a computer. He began learning English during his first grade of primary school. In 2012, he passed his Examination for the Certificate of Competency in English (<a href="https://www.hau.gr?i=examinations.el.ecce" target="_blank">ECCE</a>), also known as "Lower". In 2014, when he was a freshman in high school, he successfully acquired his Certificate of Proficiency in English (<a href="https://www.hau.gr/?i=examinations.el.ecpe" target="_blank">ECPE</a>) ,also known as just "Proficiency".

					<h3>Recent Years</h3>
					<p>
						In 2017, Panagiotis scored 18.8/20 in his entrance examinations which gave him the opportunity to enter the first university of his choice. Unfortunately, when he started studying in that department, he didn't enjoy the facility or the courses the department offered. This lead him to change universities with a procedure known in Greece as "10%". He's been a student of the department of Computer Science in Athens University of Economics and Business (<a href="https://www.aueb.gr" target="_blank">AUEB</a>) for the past 3 years. Since then, he has learned the basics of a few programming languages, technical skills and how to work with groups on projects. Αlongside his studies, he has done volunteer work for big conventions like "<a href="https://www.athenscon.gr/el/" target="_blank">AthensCon</a>" and worked on some others like "<a href="https://dexpo.gr" target="_blank">Digital Expo</a>". His goal is to graduate by the end of 2022 , so he can  start his career as a programmer.

					<h4>Hometown Fun Fact!</h4>
					<p>The ancient name Naupaktos (Ναύπακτος) means "boatyard" (from ναύς naus "ship" and πήγ- pêg- "to fix, fasten"). It was later Latinized as Naupactus. By the late medieval period, the local name had been corrupted to Nepahtos (Νέπαχτος), Epaktos or Epahtos (Έπακτος, Έπαχτος). By the "Franks" (Latins) it was called Neopant, Nepant or Lepant. French sources of the 14th century give Nepant or Neopant; Venetian sources have Nepanto or Lepanto.The name was adapted in Ottoman Turkish from Greek Νέπαχτος as Aynabahti or İnebahtı. The original ancient name was revived in modern Greece in the 19th century. (taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafpaktos" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)
