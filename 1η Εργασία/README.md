This repo was created to serve the purposes of the subject "Technologies and Programming of Web Applications" during the academic year of 2020-2021. 
## First Project 
The first assigment, which had a one month deadline, is a simple front-end only website, where the following languages were used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
## Some "Behind The Scenes"
The editor I used is "Atom". The packages that are available for it offer a great web developing experience. Plus, the built-in version control is so easy to use. I highly recommend it.
