          This page includes all the programming projects I've done so far, both for the requirements of the university and stuff I've done by myself. All the projects will be up on my <a href="https://github.com/panagiotou99" target="_blank">Github</a> account soon, so please feel free to follow me there.

					<h3>Hangman Game In Python</h3>

          <p >
						I wrote this python code back in 2018. It was one of the assigments of the course "Introduction to Computer Science". I must have finished it in 4 days. It was very easy to complete the tasks that were given to us. Also, the teachers at the labs helped me and provided me some good tips.

					<p>
						This is another one of the mandatory projects in the course "Introduction to Computer Science". I was very excited about it because I could unleash all my creativity with the crazy CSS and color palettes. I was at a very rookie level back then and I couldn't do too much functionalities though.

					<h3>DIY "Logic" Textbook</h3>

					<p>
						During the previous winter semester (2020-2021) I was attending the lectures of the "Logic" course. Unfortunately the teacher gave us only hand written notes which I had a hard time studing from. This made me write my own set of notes, with better visuals than those of the teacher's. Not going to lie, it took  me a long of time, but It helped me and other students I shared it with to prepare for the exam.

					<h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>2D Platformer in PyGame</h3>
					<img src="images/proj7.png" alt ="Screenshot of my upcoming project" width="411" height="274"  />
					<p>
						This is a project I've been working on for a while now. I'm using a library called "PyGame", which offers great features. I also designed the characters for it using a program called "Piskel". It's a coming of age story about a 16 yo boy who leaves his hometown to pursue happiness. He fights monster in the way and befriends lots of other "ethereal" creatures.

					<h3>Android Apps</h3>
					<img src="images/proj8.png" alt ="Screenshot of my upcoming project" width="411" height="274"/>
					<p>
						Soon I'll have to begin two massive projects for homework. One is for the course "Software Engeenering" and the other is for the course "Distributed Systems". They will be very time consuming , so I'll have to do my best. When I finish with them, I'll probably do some changes on my own so I can make them "Google Play" ready. By the time I'm writing this, I don't know what these projects will be about, but I'll find out very soon. I hope they don't dissapoint me.
