      <p>I believe that most students, before entering university, are eager to learn how to build their own websites. I was no exception. In the "Introduction to Computer Science" course, I had acquired basic but insufficient knowledge for web development. Through this assignment, I had the opportunity to explore many more skills of HTML and CSS languages. The most significant expertise I gained was in the use of Flexbox, as I consider it a very user-friendly tool with immense capabilities. The challenges I encountered were mainly in practicing Website Layout because I struggled to understand how CSS Grid works. I would erase my code for several consecutive nights and start over the next day. With considerable patience and even more effort, I eventually learned to handle it and was satisfied with the result.<ul>
